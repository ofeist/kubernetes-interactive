would be good to do before:
kubernetes for absolute beginners


2. cluster architecture
---
cargo and control ships analogy


master node
--
- manage
- plan
- scheduler
- monitor nodes

worker nodes
--
host applications as containers


master node consists of
--
- etcd :: key-value format db
- kube-apiserver :: orchestrator
- kube-scheduler :: how to deploy containers
- kube controller manager
	- node controller
	- replication controller


worker nodes consist of
--
- kubelet :: "the capetan"
- kube-proxy :: communication between services & containers inside of the cluster

container runtime service ( e.g. docker or rkt (rocket) )



3. & 4. etcd
---
- port: 2379
- stores / has the data about the cluster
(nodes, pods, configs, secrets, accounts, roles, bindings, others)


2 types of k8s cluster
--
- scratch
	- you have to install etcd-server by yourself
- kubeadm tool
	- deploys etcd-server as a pod in kube-system namespace
$ kubectl get pods -n kube-system


$ kubectl exec etcs-master -n kube-system
$ etcdctl get / --prefix -keys-only

- data is in the root directory
/registry/
- an then constructs such as
	- minions, pods, replicasets, deployments, roles, secrets


in HA environment
--
- there will be multiple master nodes in the cluster
- there will be multiple etcd instances spread across the master nodes
- etcd instancs shall know about each other
	- "--initial-cluster" option shall be specified



5. kube-apiserver
---
- kubectl <-reaches-the-> kube-apiserver (authorization/validation) <-retreaves-data-from-> etcd cluster
- kube-apiserver then authentizates and validates request


an example: create a pod (not using kubectl, but per APIs)
---
1] apiserver then creates a pod object without assigning it to a node
# curl -X POST /api/v1/namespaces/default/pods ...[other]
- the request is authenticated
- the request is validated
- etcd is updated
- the user gets back the info


2] scheduler
- cont. monitors apiserver and realizes there is a new pod without a new node assigned
- updates kube-apiserver where to put the pod

3] kubeapi-server
- updates etcd-= cluster
- places the pod onto a worker node
