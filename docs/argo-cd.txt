gitops principles
---

1] declarative
- the garden should be wattered for 15 minutes
- ass opposed to the imperative statement


2] versioned and immutable
- not "the latest version"

3] pulled automatically
- gitops agent sitting on the target
- checking the source of truth (git)
- comparing with live environment

4] continuously reconciled
